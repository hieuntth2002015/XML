        He is free who lives as he wishes to live; who is neither
        subject to compulsion nor to hindrance, nor to force;
        whose movements to action are not impeded, whose desires
        anttain their purpose, and who does not fall into that which
        he would avoid.

    <paragraph>
        Do we then find any of the bad free from sorrow, free from
        fear, who does not fall into that which he would avoid, and
        does not abtain that which he wishe? Not one; nor then do
        we find any bad man free.
